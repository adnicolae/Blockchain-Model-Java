# Blockychain - Basic proof of concept blockchain implementation. (WIP)

Run using the `java -jar target/Blockychain-1.0.jar` command.

Uses a proof-of-work hashcash approach to mining based on the starting number of 0s in hash dictated by the difficulty.
The jar is set to a difficulty of 5, which should take around 3 seconds to generate 5 blocks.
